# Lists

In `fuse` we offer two types of lists when building fields `t.list` and `t.connection`.
The difference between the two is their specialization, `t.connection` is specialised towards
cursor-based pagination and `t.list` is more general purpose.

## List

When using the `list` type as followed:

```typescript
import { addQueryFields } from 'fuse'

addQueryFields((t) => ({
  users: t.list({
    type: UserNode,
    nullable: false,
    args: {
      offset: t.arg.int(),
      limit: t.arg.int(),
    },
    resolve: async (_, args, context) => {
      const result = await getUsers({
        skip: args.offset,
        take: args.limit,
      })

      return {
        // It's also possible to return a list of ids here in case your
        // list endpoint doesn't have all the needed details of the user
        // then the node will resolve the rest of the entity.
        nodes: result.users,
        totalCount: result.totalCount,
      }
    },
  }),
}))
```

For the above, we get a GraphQL type like this:

```graphql
type UserList {
  nodes: [User]!
  totalCount: Int
}

type Query {
  users(limit: Int, offset: Int): UserList!
}
```

The `nodes` will output the type you specify the `list` to return, the `totalCount` has been made `optional`
on purpose in case your datasource does not return this information.

## Connection

When using the `connection` type as followed:

```typescript
import { addQueryFields } from 'fuse'

addQueryFields((t) => ({
  users: t.connection({
    type: UserNode,
    nullable: false,
    resolve: async (_, args, context) => {
      const result = await getUsers({
        skip: args.offset,
        take: args.limit,
      })

      return {
        edges: result.users.map(user => ({
          node: user,
          cursor: user.id,
        })),
        pageInfo: getPageInfo(result),
      }
    },
  }),
}))
```

For the above, we get a GraphQL type like this:

```graphql
type UserEdge {
  cursor: String!
  node: User!
}

type PageInfo {
  hasNextPage: Boolean!
  hasPreviousPage: Boolean!
  startCursor: String!
  endCursor: String!
}

type UserConnection {
  edges: [UserEdge]!
  pageInfo: PageInfo!
}

type Query {
  ## Note that the arguments for cursor-based pagination are included automatically
  users(after: String, before: String, first: Int, last: Int): QueryLaunchesConnection!
}
```

As you can see, this type is a lot more in-depth and gears towards cursor-based pagination. The `edges` can
be customised to for instance carry relational attributes, this could for instance be the `role` of the user in
relation to the parent where this connection is being queried from.
