# Authorization

In some cases you might not wish to fully rely on your datasource to perform
authorization like in the case of a database or you want to optimise to terminate
requests as soon as possible.

In these cases you can use `auth-scopes` to perform authorization both on the field- as well
as type-level.

## Setting up

To use the `auth-scopes` we'll need to create a new file in `types/` where we'll
define the type for our scope as well as how to resolve it.

```ts
import 'fuse'
import { defineAuthScopes, Scopes } from 'fuse'

declare module 'fuse' {
  export interface Scopes {
    isLoggedIn: boolean
  }
}

defineAuthScopes<Scopes>((ctx) => ({
  isLoggedIn: !!ctx.user,
  isAdmin: !!ctx.admin,
  canAccessUser: (userId) => ctx.allowedIds.includes(userId)
}))
```

In the above we define three scopes. The scopes `isLoggedIn` and `isAdmin` allow us to
restrict access to types or fields based on the users role - anonymous, logged in and/or admin.
The scope `canAccessUser` takes a parameter. The parameter allows us to dynamically restrict
access to individual instances of a type. For example a user should be able to access `Query.user`
for them selves and their colleagues, but not for user ids outside of their own organisation.

An important note here is that we are using [the context](./context) to setup these scopes. 
Therefore we must define the `user` and `allowedIds` on the context when we are 
executing our request.

## Using scopes

Now that we have defined our scopes we can use them in our schema

```ts
import { node } from 'fuse';

const UserNode = node<
  UserSource,
>({
  name: 'User',
  // These functions allow you to do full logic i.e. you can also return
  // scopes conditionally based on some super-admin privilege where you
  // just do return true; instead of return {}
  authScopes: (parent, args) => ({ canAccessUser: parent.id || args.id }),
  load: async (ids) => getUsers(ids),
  fields: (t) => ({
    name: t.exposeString('name'),
    avatarUrl: t.exposeString('avatarUrl'),
    secretField: t.exposeString('secretField', {
      authScopes: { isAdmin: true },
    }),
  }),
})
```

Now anytime we query `Query.node(id: ID!)` or `Query.user(id: ID!)` we will check if the
consumer of said request is allowed to access a given `id`. When we request `secretField`
we will check if the consumer is an admin, if they're not but they are allowed to access the user
because it's a nullable field it will show up as `null` but the other fields will be resolved
correctly.

We can also define our scopes on the query-field level:

```ts
import { addQueryFields } from 'fuse';

addQueryFields((t) => ({
  me: t.field({
    type: 'User',
    authScopes: {
      isLoggedIn: true,
    },
    resolve: () => {
      return true
    },
  }),
}))
```

> Note that using complex values as an input to auth-scope functions will result in
> lower performance as we can't generate effective cache-keys for them.
