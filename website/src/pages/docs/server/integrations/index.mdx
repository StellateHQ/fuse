# Integrating data sources with Fuse

Fuse can serve data from any source since [nodes](/docs/server/nodes) can fetch data from anywhere:

```ts
type SourceType = {
  // define the shape of the data coming from the underlying source
}

const Node = node<SourceType>({
  load: (ids) => {
    // fetch data from anywhere here and return it
  }
})
```

However, manually typing the `SourceType` for the underlying data source is unnecessary if your data source is already typed with TypeScript. We have written guides on **how to get TypeScript types for some common data sources** that you might interact with to avoid having to manually type the `SourceType`:

- [gRPC](/docs/server/integrations/grpc)
- [REST APIs](/docs/server/integrations/rest)
- [Prisma ORM (PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite, MongoDB,…)](/docs/server/integrations/prisma)
- [Drizzle ORM (PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite)](/docs/server/integrations/drizzle)
- [Kysely (any SQL database)](/docs/server/integrations/kysely)

## Fuse does not turn data sources into GraphQL automatically

Converting a data source into an API automatically almost always leads to a suboptimal result because the way underlying data sources manage their data does not match the way that clients want to consume that data.

In practice, we observe the 80/20 rule: APIs expose some minor percentage (~20%) of the underlying data directly, and the majority (~80%) of the data is transformed in some way to match more closely to the client's needs.

That's why Fuse is optimized for and designed to be the easiest way to build a transformation layer that takes any underlying data source and turn it into an interface that matches what clients need with end-to-end typesafety.

To simplify integrating data sources into your Fuse API, instead of automatic converters, we recommend using technologies that create TypeScript types for underlying data sources (like `connect-es` for gRPC, Prisma/Drizzle/Kysely for SQL databases,…), which drastically simplifies integrating them with Fuse.

In fact, to give you an example, here is how to interact with a database with Drizzle without any need for manual typing at all:

```ts
import { node, NotFoundError } from 'fuse'
import { inArray } from 'drizzle-orm';
import { db, users } from './db'

// Automatically infer the underlying User database table schema from the generated types from Drizzle
export const UserNode = node<typeof users.$inferInsert>({
  name: 'User',
  async load(ids) {
    const result = await db.select().from(users).where(inArray(users.id, ids))
    return ids.map((id) => result.find((x) => x.id === id) || new NotFoundError('Could not find user.'));
  },
  fields: (t) => ({
    name: t.exposeString('name'),
  }),
})
```
