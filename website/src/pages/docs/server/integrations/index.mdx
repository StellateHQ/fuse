# Integrating data sources with Fuse

Fuse can serve data from any source since [nodes](/docs/server/nodes) can fetch data from anywhere:

```ts
type SourceType = {
  // define the shape of the data coming from the underlying source
}

const Node = node<SourceType>({
  load: (ids) => {
    // fetch data from anywhere here and return it
  }
})
```

However, manually typing the `SourceType` for the underlying data source is unnecessary if your data source is already typed with TypeScript. We have written guides on **how to get TypeScript types for some common data sources** that you might interact with to avoid having to manually type the `SourceType`:

- [gRPC](/docs/server/integrations/grpc)
- [REST APIs](/docs/server/integrations/rest)
