# Mocking data

Sometimes you're waiting for the backend team to add a new property to the resource, that
however should not stop you from developing the frontend. You can mock the data in the API
and prototype your feature on top of that.

## Mocking fields

You can mock fields by adding a custom <Explain term='resolvers'>resolver</Explain> to a field
like the following example

```ts
import { node } from 'fuse'

type UserSource = {
  id: string
  name: string
  avatarUrl: string
  // We know the back-end will add this so we can prepare ourselves
  // by adding it here already. Note that we make the property optional
  // with the "?" operator.
  phoneNumber?: string
}

export const UserNode = node<
  UserSource,
>({
  name: 'User',
  load: async (ids) => getUsers(ids),
  fields: (t) => ({
    name: t.exposeString('name'),
    avatarUrl: t.exposeString('avatarUrl'),
    firstName: t.string({
      resolve: (user) => user.name.split(' ')[0],
    }),
    phoneNumber: t.string({
      // When the back-end starts returning the phoneNumber we
      // can switch of off our mock but for the time being we can
      // develop the UI on top of this mock.
      resolve: (user) => user.phoneNumber || '13-850175-913761-7',
    })
  }),
})
```

## Mocking nodes/objects

Another issue could be that we are missing a relation-ship or an entry-point to a resource.
We can also cover that case by returning a full object! The back-end here is working on a feature
to add a favorite author to the user, we can mock the return value as well as add the entry-point
to the mutations!

```ts
import { addNodeFields } from 'fuse'

addNodeFields(UserNode, t => ({
  favoriteAuthor: t.field({
    type: UserNode,
    resolve: () => ({
      id: '1',
      name: 'Stephen King',
      avatarUrl: 'https://i.imgur.com/WxNkK7J.png',
      phoneNumber: '13-850175-913761-7',
    })
  })
}))
```

```ts
import { addMutationFields } from 'fuse'

addMutationFields(t => ({
  addFavoriteAuthor: t.field({
    type: UserNode,
    args: {
      authorId: t.arg.string(),
    },
    resolve: (_, { authorId }) => ({
      id: authorId,
      name: 'Stephen King',
      avatarUrl: 'https://i.imgur.com/WxNkK7J.png',
      phoneNumber: '13-850175-913761-7',
    })
  })
}))
```

When the back-end implements the URL whwere we can fetch the author we can remove the mock
and the UI will start working with the real data.
