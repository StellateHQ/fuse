# Best practices

We'll touch on some best practices while you are using `fuse` to build your application.

## Co-locate your fragments

When creating components it's useful to co-locate your data-requirements with your component,
this way when you need more data for your component you know exactly where to add it and
you don't have to go up your component-tree to find the `query` responsible for adding the data.

```tsx
import { FragmentType, graphql, useFragment } from '@/gql'
import styles from './Avatar.module.css'

const UserFields = graphql(`
  fragment Avatar_UserFields on Launch {
    firstName
    avatarUrl
  }
`)

export const Avatar = (props: {
  user: FragmentType<typeof UserFields>
}) => {
  const user = useFragment(LaunchFields, props.user)

  return (
    <div styles={styles.avatar}>
      <img styles={styles.image} href={user.avatarUrl} alt="...">
      <span>Welcome, {user.firstName}</span>
    </div>
  )
}
```

The above defined fragment is now globally available and we can add it to our query:

```tsx
const UserQuery = graphql(`
  query User ($id: ID!) {
    user(id: $id) {
      id
      ...Avatar_UserFields
    }
  }
`)
```

From now on out, every time we need a new field in the `Avatar` component we can just add it there
and trust that the query is updated automatically and our data is passed into the component by menans of
`<Avatar user={result.data.user} />`.
