# Nodes

The `node` function is a core abstraction in `fuse`, it allows you to express a way to load
a key-able* entity and its shape. By defining the way to load the entity we enable a few use-cases

- We can return the `key` of the node at any point in our graph and the `load` function defined on the `node` will take care of resolving the full entity
- We can return a list of `keys` when our list endpoint does not return the full entity and the `load` function will take care of loading these in parallel.

A few things this endpoint does for you is create an automatic entry-point for the `node` query-field as well as the lower-cased `type` query-field (in this case `user`) and
we'll ensure that the `id` of this entity is globally unique.

A `node` will define its <Explain>fields</Explain>, this is what it will expose to the outside world, <Explain>fields</Explain> can be a
translation of properties on the `Resource`, computed properties or just plainly expose the property as-is. Every field is <Explain term='nullability'>nullable</Explain> by default,
unless you explicitly define it as non-nullable by means of `nullable: false`.

Let's look at the example of the [Getting Started](../index.mdx) guide:

```ts
import { node } from 'fuse'

type UserSource = {
  id: string
  name: string
  avatarUrl: string
}

export const UserNode = node<
  UserSource,
  // This is the default, you can change this when you use a different type, like number.
  // string
>({
  name: 'User',
  // This is the default, however if you use a different key-field property you can change this.
  // key: 'id',
  load: async (ids) => getUsers(ids),
  fields: (t) => ({
    name: t.exposeString('name'),
    avatarUrl: t.exposeString('avatarUrl'),
    firstName: t.string({
      // resolve here allows us to compute this property with
      // the data we have available from the resource.
      resolve: (user) => user.name.split(' ')[0],
    }),
  }),
})
```

If we were to have a list endpoint that only returned the `name` and was missing `avatarUrl` we could do the following:

```ts
addQueryFields((t) => ({
  users: t.field({
    type: [UserNode],
    resolve: async () => {
      const result = await listUsers()
      return result.map(user => user.id)
    }
  }),
}))
```

Now the underlying API knows it needs to go back to the `load` function and resolve all the details for these keys.
Similarly if we were to have an `objectField` that needs to return a `UserNode` we can just return the `id` and
the [dataloader](https://github.com/graphql/dataloader) will ensure that these are loaded in parallel.

> *key-able: A key-able entity is an entity that has a unique identifier that can be used to load the entity.

Example of querying the automatically generated entry-points:

```graphql
query {
  node(id: x) {
    ... on User { id firstName }
  }
  user(id: x) {
    id
    firstName
  }
}
```

## Globally unique identifiers

You might notice when querying your `node` that the value for your `key` is slightly different
than what you expect. This is because we ensure that the `key` is globally unique, in our case
we will take the name of the `type` (in the above case `User`) and base64 encode it with the
`key` (in the above case `id`).

This results in having a globally unique identifier that we can easily decode to be of a certain type
and if we so choose we can keep an entity-independent cache across types that won't result in collisions.

When you use `t.arg.id` and the `ID` output field to signal that we potentially dealing with an encoded `key`
we will do the translation back for you.

This means when we'd get a list back as a result of `query { users { id firstName } }` that it might look like

```json
{
  "users": [
    { "id": "VXNlcjox", "firstName": "John" },
    { "id": "VXNlcjoy", "firstName": "Jane" }
  ]
}
```

Both ids respectively translate to `User:1` and `User:2`, now we can ues that in for instance our
`user(id: ID!)` or `node(id: ID!)` queries.

Let's expand the example from above, we can query the `node` field on `Query` with the globally unique `key` we
retrieved from our list:

```graphql
query ($id: ID!) {
  node(id: $id) {
    ... on User { id firstname }
  }
}
```

Now we can invoke that with `VXNlcjox` and we'll get our user named `John` as a result.

## Connecting nodes

In the datalayer we want our data to be connected so we can do a single API call to retrieve
all the resources we need to show the data on the screen.

### Referencing other nodes

For 1:1 relationships you can add a field to your `node` that returns the `key` of the related node.
In doing so it will take the `key` and invoke the `load` function of the related node.

When doing so you'll see that we have a `resolve` function similar to the `firstName` field above,
rather than computing a new property we are telling our field the key that we want loaded. Returning
this `key` will make the `UserNode` load the full `User` object. In resolvers we can see the first property
being named `parent` in our case this is the `BlogPostSource` which is the object we loaded from our
external datasource.

```ts
export const BlogPostNode = node<BlogPostSource>({
  name: 'BlogPost',
  load: async (ids) => fetchBlogPosts(ids),
  fields: (t) => ({
    // Exose a field as-is
    title: t.exposeString('title'),
    author: t.field({
      // This refers to the UserNode we created earlier,
      // the id will be used to load the full object.
      type: UserNode,
      resolve: (parent) => parent.author_id
    })
  }),
})
```

The benefit here is that when your parent is a list that all of the related nodes will be loaded in parallel.

### Extending nodes

When we have a more complex relationship or don't have the `key` of the related entity at hand we can choose to
extend the `node`.

```ts
import { addNodeFields } from 'fuse'

addNodeFields(UserNode, t => ({
  blogPosts: t.field({
    type: [BlogPostNode],
    resolve: (parent) => fetchBlogPostsByAuthor(parent.id)
  })
}))
```

This adds a new field to the `node` named `blogPosts` and the resolver will fetch all
the blog posts of the `user`.

> If we want to optmise this to load in parallel as well we can use `t.loadableList` instead of `t.field`.

## How to handle authorization

Authorization can be hard to reason about in these cases, this is why
we thought about a few ways to handle this.

You can centralise authorization to the `node` of an entity, this would mean
implementing the logic in the `load` function. This means that every time
you need to go to the `load` function to resolve an entity it will run
through the authorization logic by default. This does mean that if you need
a different contextual authority you can't just return the identifier.

Alternatively if you know that the underlying datasource is already
running authorization you can choose to defer that logic to the datasource.
