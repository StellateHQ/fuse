# Nodes

The `node` function is a core abstraction in `fuse`, it allows you to express a way to load
a key-able* entity and its shape. By defining the way to load the entity we enable a few use-cases

- We can return the `key` of the node at any point in our graph and the `load` function defined on the `node` will take care of resolving the full entity
- We can return a list of `keys` when our list endpoint does not return the full entity and the `load` function will take care of loading these in parallel.

A few things this endpoint does for you is create an automatic entry-point for the `node` query-field as well as the lower-cased `type` query-field (in this case `user`) and
we'll ensure that the `id` of this entity is globally unique.

Let's look at the example of the [Getting Started](../index.mdx) guide:

```ts
import { node } from 'fuse'

type UserSource = {
  id: string
  name: string
  avatarUrl: string
}

export const UserNode = node<
  UserSource,
  // This is the default, you can change this when you use a different type, like number.
  // string
>({
  name: 'User',
  // This is the default, however if you use a different key-field property you can change this.
  // key: 'id',
  load: async (ids) => getUsers(ids),
  fields: (t) => ({
    name: t.exposeString('name'),
    avatarUrl: t.exposeString('avatarUrl'),
    firstName: t.string({
      resolve: (user) => user.name.split(' ')[0],
    }),
  }),
})
```

If we were to have a list endpoint that only returned the `name` and was missing `avatarUrl` we could do the following:

```ts
addQueryFields((t) => ({
  users: t.field({
    type: [UserNode],
    resolve: async () => {
      const result = await listUsers()
      return result.map(user => user.id);
    }
  }),
}))
```

Now the underlying API knows it needs to go back to the `load` function and resolve all the details for these keys.
Similarly if we were to have an `objectField` that needs to return a `UserNode` we can just return the `id` and
the [dataloader](https://github.com/graphql/dataloader) will ensure that these are loaded in parallel.

> *key-able: A key-able entity is an entity that has a unique identifier that can be used to load the entity.

Example of querying the automatically generated entry-points:

```graphql
query {
  node(id: x) {
    ... on User { id firstName }
  }
  user(id: x) {
    id
    firstName
  }
}
```

## How to handle authorization

Authorization can be hard to reason about in these cases, this is why
we thought about a few ways to handle this.

You can centralise authorization to the `node` of an entity, this would mean
implementing the logic in the `load` function. This means that every time
you need to go to the `load` function to resolve an entity it will run
through the authorization logic by default. This does mean that if you need
a different contextual authority you can't just return the identifier.

Alternatively if you know that the underlying datasource is already
running authorization you can choose to defer that logic to the datasource.
