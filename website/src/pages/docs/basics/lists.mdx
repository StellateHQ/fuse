# Lists

In `fuse` we offer two types of lists when building fields `t.list` and `t.connection`.
The difference between the two is their specialization, `t.connection` is specialised towards
cursor-based pagination and `t.list` is more general purpose.

## List

When using the `list` type you will get an output type that looks like the following:

```graphql
type UserList {
  nodes: [User]!
  totalCount: Int
}
```

The `nodes` will output the type you specify the `list` to return, the `totalCount` has been made `optional`
on purpose in case your datasource does not return this information.

## Connection

When using the `connection` type you will get an output type that looks like the following:

```graphql
type UserEdge {
  cursor: String!
  node: User!
}

type PageInfo {
  hasNextPage: Boolean!
  hasPreviousPage: Boolean!
  startCursor: String!
  endCursor: String!
}

type UserConnection {
  edges: [UserEdge]!
  pageInfo: PageInfo!
}
```

As you can see, this type is a lot more in-depth and gears towards cursor-based pagination. The `edges` can
be customised to for instance carry relational attributes, this could for instance be the `role` of the user in
relation to the parent where this connection is being queried from.
