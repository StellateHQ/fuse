# Querying from the client

Depending on whether you are querying data from [React Server Components](./server-components.mdx),
a [client component in the app router](./client-components.mdx), or a
[client component in the pages router](./page-components.mdx), you will need to use a
different set of data fetching helpers.

## <Explain>Fragments</Explain>

One of the pillars of `fuse` is Fragment <Explain term='colocation'>co-location</Explain>, we strongly believe that this patterns helps
us get a better overview of our data-requirements and makes it easier to reason about the data
a component will receive.

When creating components it's useful to co-locate your data-requirements with your component,
this way when you need more data for your component you know exactly where to add it and
you don't have to go up your component-tree to find the `query` responsible for adding the data.

```tsx
import { FragmentType, graphql, useFragment } from '@/fuse'
import styles from './Avatar.module.css'

const UserFields = graphql(`
  fragment Avatar_UserFields on Launch {
    firstName
    avatarUrl
  }
`)

export const Avatar = (props: {
  user: FragmentType<typeof UserFields>
}) => {
  const user = useFragment(LaunchFields, props.user)

  return (
    <div styles={styles.avatar}>
      <img styles={styles.image} href={user.avatarUrl} alt="...">
      <span>Welcome, {user.firstName}</span>
    </div>
  )
}
```

The above defined fragment is now globally available and we can add it to our query:

```tsx
const UserQuery = graphql(`
  query User ($id: ID!) {
    user(id: $id) {
      id
      ...Avatar_UserFields
    }
  }
`)
```

From now on out, every time we need a new field in the `Avatar` component we can just add it there
and trust that the query is updated automatically and our data is passed into the component by menans of
`<Avatar user={result.data.user} />`.

All Fragments you define in a component will be globally available, this means that if your client components
define their data requirements you can <Explain term='fragment-spreads'>spread</Explain> your fragments in
your top-level server-component and pass the data down.

## Type-conditions

Something you might notice when we define a fragment is that we add this `on X` keyword after the name,
this is called a <Explain term='type-condition'>type-condition</Explain> and is used to tell the GraphQL
that we only want those fields when the type is either `X` or a type that inherits from `X` (like with interfaces).

## Generated files

When you run `next dev` for the first time you'll see the `fuse/` folder populate
with a bunch of files. These don't need to be touched and are mostly there to
help with typing your results, variables and facilitating the client-methods.

Let's go over each file:

- [`fuse/server.ts`](./server-components.mdx): This is the main entry-point for the `/app` directory when you are
  working with server-components and server-actions. It exports an `execute` function
  which takes a <Explain term='documents'>`Document`</Explain> and `variables` and will perform that on the datalayer.
- [`fuse/client.ts`](./client-components.mdx): This is the main entry-point for the `/app` directory when you are
  in `'use client'` mode. It exports the `useQuery`/... hooks which you can use in your
  components to talk to your datalayer.
- [`fuse/pages.ts`](./page-components.mdx): This is the main entry-point for the `/pages` directory.
  It exports the `withUrqlClinet` and `initUrqlClient` to work with `getServerSideProps`, ...
  As well as React hooks which you can use in your components.
- [`fuse/fragment-masking.ts`](./best-practices.mdx): The `useFragment` and `FragmentType` helpers are exported from here,
  these helpers basically ensure that the props you pass in will be reduced to the selection of fields
  of your <Explain term='fragments'>fragment</Explain>.
- `fuse/gql.ts`: The `graphql()` function is exported from here, this helper ensures that both the `Result`
  and `Variables` are typed correctly for a given <Explain term='documents'>`Document`</Explain>.
- `fuse/graphql.ts`: This file contains a translation of your GraphQL schema to TypeScript types.
  It also contains the <Explain term='documents'>`Document`</Explain> type which is a helper type to type your GraphQL documents.
