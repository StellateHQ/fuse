# Client components

When you are leveraging the `use client` directive in a `/app` component we have opted out
of using server-components. This means we are going back to the traditional way of
distributing our client over `React.context`.

It is advisable to create a `Provider` component with `'use client'` that you use in your
root-layout component so we are enabled to query data in any client page.

```tsx
'use client'

import {
  Provider,
  createClient,
} from '@/fuse/client'
import React from 'react'

export const DatalayerProvider = (props: any) => {
  const [client, ssr] = React.useMemo(() => {
    const { client, ssr } = createClient({
      url: 'http://localhost:3000/api/fuse',
      // This is used during SSR to know when the data finishes loading
      suspense: true,
    })

    return [client, ssr]
  }, [])

  return (
    <Provider client={client} ssr={ssr}>
      <React.Suspense>
        {props.children}
      </React.Suspense>
    </Provider>
  )
}
```

Let's add this to `app/layout.tsx` so we are enabled to query data in any subsequent page.
Querying data cna be done by using the `useQuery` hook from your generated fuse folder.

```tsx
import { useQuery } from '@/fuse/client'
import { graphql } from '@/fuse'

const UserQuery = graphql(`
  query User ($id: ID!) {
    user(id: $id) {
      ...Avatar_UserFields
    }
  }
`)

function User() {
  const [result] = useQuery({
    query: UserQuery,
    variables: { id: '1' },
  })
}
```

When you need to reach into your mutatation entry points we supply `useMutation` as well.

```tsx
import { graphql } from '@/fuse'
import { useMutation } from '@/fuse/client'

const UpdateUser = graphql(`
  mutation UpdateUser ($id: ID!, firstName: $String!) {
    user(id: $id, firstName: $firstName) {
      ...Avatar_UserFields
    }
  }
`)

const UpdateUser = () => {
  const [result, update] = useMutation(UpdateUser)

  return (
    <button onClick={() => update({ id: '1', firstName: 'John' })}>
      Update user
    </button>
  )
}
```

> When you mutate data that is queried from a server-component you will need to
> call `router.refresh()` to re-render your server-component. The router is a hook
> exported from `next/navigation` named `useRouter`.

For data queried from client-components the client cache will recognise that data got
altered and performa refetch. The cache matches this by means of the `__typename` property
that is available on the data.

> Heads up, when you query a list of items that is empty we won't be able to infer the
> `__typename` and you will need to supply it yourself.

```tsx
import { useMemo } from 'react'
import { graphql } from '@/fuse'
import { useQuery } from '@/fuse/client'

const UserQuery = graphql(`
  query User ($id: ID!) {
    user(id: $id) {
      ...Avatar_UserFields
    }
  }
`)

const User = () => {
  const [result] = useQuery({
    query: UserQuery,
    variables: { id: '1' },
    context: useMemo(() => ({ additionalTypenames: ['User'] }), []),
  })
}

```

Similar to the above we can perform mutations on the client as well by means of the `useMutation` hook,
this hook is lazy, when we invoke it we'll get a function that we can invoke to execute it.

```tsx

import { graphql } from '@/fuse'
import { useMutation } from '@/fuse/client'
import { redirect } from 'next/navigation'

const SayHello = graphql(`
  mutation Hello($name: String!) {
    sayHello(name: $name)
  }
`)

export async function Greet(args: { name: string }) {
  const [result, execute] = useMutation(SayHello)

  return <button onClick={() => execute({ name })}>Greet</button>
}
```
