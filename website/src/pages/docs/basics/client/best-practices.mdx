# Best practices

There are some best practices we strongly believe in while developing with `fuse`.

## `useFragment` and `FragmentType`

You'll see that we use this `useFragment` function in our components that have a fragment describing their
data-requirements, this helper ensures that we remove any extraneous fields and type the output correctly.
Another thing worth noting is how we type the `props`, we use this `FragmentType` helper which ensures that
the parent-component uses the fragment and passes that into props, this means that if the parent-component
would define all the fields of the fragment manually and not spread it that we would show a warning.

  Note that even though this function is called `useFragment`, it is **not a React hook and you need to use it in server components too**.

## Top-level queries

One of the benefits that comes with describing the data you need is that you perform 1 request and get 1 response,
no waterfall where you need to wait for the list and then perform a whole set of other requests to enrich that data, ...
We wrangle the data once, with this comes our sugestion to aggregate the data you need by means of your fragments at
the page-level, in doing so you resolve all data in a single request.

With modals/... that pop up you can do one-off requests later when you need the data but not having a waterfall of loading
spinners because you are navigating around feels both more performant and more user-friendly.
