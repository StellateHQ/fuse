# Setting fuse up manually

These steps are the same as what `create-fuse-app` does under the hood, we'll
go over them so you know what the command does.

## Setup

<Steps>
### Install the npm packages

```sh npm2yarn
npm install --save fuse graphql
npm install --save-dev @graphql-typed-document-node/core
```

### Add the Next.js plugin to your `next.config.js`

```js
const { nextFusePlugin } = require('fuse/next/plugin')

/** @type {import('next').NextConfig} */
const nextConfig = nextFusePlugin()({
  // Your Next.js config here
})

module.exports = nextConfig
```

### Create the `/api/fuse` API route

This API route will serve as the entrypoint to the GraphQL API that Fuse.js creates. If you are using Next.js’s app router, add a file at `app/api/fuse/route.ts` and copy the below code to it:

```ts
import { createAPIRouteHandler } from 'fuse/next'

// NOTE: This makes Fuse.js automatically pick up every type in the /types folder
// Alternatively, you can manually import each type in the /types folder and remove this snippet
// @ts-expect-error
const files = require.context('../../../types', true, /\.ts$/)
files
  .keys()
  .filter((path: string) => path.includes('types/'))
  .forEach(files)

const handler = createAPIRouteHandler()

export const GET = handler
export const POST = handler
```

<Callout type="info" emoji="📄">
  If you are using Next.js's Pages Router, replace <code>createAPIRouteHandler</code> with <code>createPagesRouteHandler</code> instead.
</Callout>

That’s it! Fuse.js will now serve a GraphQL API at `/api/fuse`.

</Steps>

### Adding your first type

Create a `types` folder at the root of your Next.js app and add a file at `types/User.ts` that contains the following code:

```ts
import { node } from 'fuse'

type UserSource = {
  id: string
  name: string
  avatar_url: string
}

// "Nodes" are the core abstraction of Fuse.js. Each node represents
// a resource/entity with multiple fields and has to define two things:
// 1. load(): How to fetch from the underlying data source
// 2. fields: What fields should be exposed and added for clients
export const UserNode = node<UserSource>({
  name: 'User',
  load: async (ids) => getUsers(ids),
  fields: (t) => ({
    name: t.exposeString('name'),
    // rename to camel-case
    avatarUrl: t.exposeString('avatar_url'),
    // Add an additional firstName field
    firstName: t.string({
      resolve: (user) => user.name.split(' ')[0],
    }),
  }),
})

// Fake function to fetch users. In real applications, this would
// talk to an underlying REST API/gRPC service/third-party API/…
async function getUsers(ids: string[]): Promise<UserSource[]> {
  return ids.map((id) => ({
    id,
    name: `Peter #${id}`,
    avatarUrl: `https://i.pravatar.cc/300?u=${id}`,
  }))
}
```

Note how the only code you had to write was the translation from the underlying data source to the shape of the data that you need. Fuse.js takes care of everything else for you.

## Set up GraphQLSP to get IDE autocomplete

You can use `@0no-co/graphqlsp` to get inline hints while authoring GraphQL documents, you can do so by installing it
with `npm i --save-dev @0no-co/graphqlsp` and using the following in your `tsconfig.json`:

```json
{
  "name": "@0no-co/graphqlsp",
  "schema": "./schema.graphql",
  "disableTypegen": true,
  "templateIsCallExpression": true,
  "template": "graphql"
}
```

When using `.vscode` you will need to use the workspace version of TypeScript, to do so you can easily do that by creating
`.vscode/settings.json` with the following content

```json
{
  "typescript.tsdk": "node_modules/typescript/lib",
  "typescript.enablePromptUseWorkspaceTsdk": true
}
```
