# context

You might have noticed that in our `load` and `resolve` functions that we don't have the request
parameters readily available to us, we might however need them to check i.e. if a user is authorized, ...
This is done through the `context` object which will be carried around throughout the whole request lifecycle.

The `context` parameter can be found as the second parameter in the `load` function and the third of the `resolve` function.

## API-Route

By default we will expose `params` and `headers` on the context object. If you want to expose more data you can do so by
adding it to the function invocation of your API handler.

```ts
createAPIRouteHandler<{ userAgent: string }>({
  context: (ctx) => {
    return {
      userAgent: ctx.headers.get('user-agent') || 'unknown',
    }
  }
})
```

Now the `userAgent` will be available to all of our GraphQL resolvers!

## Server components

In `server-components` we don't have the `headers` available by default when using the `execute` function, this
to avoid automatically opting people into [dynamic functions](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/rendering/server-components#dynamic-functions).
We'll have to pass these in with the second argument of our `execute` function.

```ts
import { headers } from 'next/headers';

execute({
  query: x,
  variables: {},
  context: () => {
    return {
      userAgent: headers().get('user-agent') || 'unknown'
    }
  } 
})
```

> This means that if you use `context.headers` or a related property in your resolvers that you will need to define this yourself
> if your executed document would tap into those resolvers.
