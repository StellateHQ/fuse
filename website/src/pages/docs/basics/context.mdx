# context

You might have noticed that in our `load` and `resolve` functions that we don't have the request
parameters readily available to us, we might however need them to check i.e. if a user is authorized, ...
This is done through the `context` object which will be carried around throughout the whole request lifecycle.

## API-Route

By default we will expose `params` and `headers` on the context object. If you want to expose more data you can do so by
adding it to the function invocation of your API handler.

```ts
import { createAPIRouteHandler } from 'fuse/next'

createAPIRouteHandler<{ userAgent: string }>({
  context: (ctx) => {
    return {
      userAgent: ctx.headers.get('user-agent') || 'unknown',
    }
  }
})
```

Now the `userAgent` will be available to all of our GraphQL resolvers!

## Server components

In `server-components` we don't have the `headers` available by default when using the `execute` function, this
to avoid automatically opting people into [dynamic functions](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/rendering/server-components#dynamic-functions).
We'll have to pass these in with the second argument of our `execute` function.

```ts
import { headers } from 'next/headers'
import { createAPIRouteHandler } from '@/fuse/server'

execute({
  query: x,
  variables: {},
  context: () => {
    return {
      userAgent: headers().get('user-agent') || 'unknown'
    }
  } 
})
```

> This means that if you use `context.headers` or a related property in your resolvers that you will need to define this yourself
> if your executed <Explain term='documents'>document</Explain> would tap into those resolvers.

## Using `context` in your API

In our <Explain term='fields'>fields</Explain> there are two opportunities we have to use `context` the first being during `resolve` and the second during `load`,
below you can find an example of both.

```ts
import { node, addQueryFields, AuthenticationError } from 'fuse'

const UserNode = node<UserSource>({
  name: 'User',
  load: async (ids, ctx) => ctx.isAdmin ? getUsers(ids) : [],
  fields: (t) => ({
    name: t.exposeString('name'),
    // rename to camel-case
    avatarUrl: t.exposeString('avatar_url'),
    // Add an additional firstName field
    firstName: t.string({
      resolve: (user) => user.name.split(' ')[0],
    }),
  }),
})

addQueryFields((t) => ({
  me: t.list({
    type: UserNode,
    nullable: false,
    args: {
      offset: t.arg.int({}),
      limit: t.arg.int(),
      filter: t.arg({ type: FilterInput }),
    },
    resolve: async (_, args, context) => {
      if (context.userId) {
        return context.userId
      }

      throw new AuthenticationError('You must be logged in.')
    },
  }),
}))
```

## Static typing

You can ensure that your `Context` is typed in both your server
as well as your client code by overriding the global type in `fuse`:

```ts
// Important so the surrounding types won't override
import 'fuse'

declare module 'fuse' {
  // This basically means that the `context` needs to define
  // a userId
  export interface UserContext {
    userId: string | null
  }
}
```
