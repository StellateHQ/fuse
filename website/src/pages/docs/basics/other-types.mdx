# Other types

There are more building blocks available in `fuse` to manage your data-sources and how
you expose them to your application.

## Objects

In the [`nodes`](./nodes.mdx) we talked about keyed entities and that we can `load` them
by means of their `key`. This doesn't cover all the cases, you won't want to expose a `node`
interface/... for every given `entity` in your graph and some of them might not have unique
keys.

In comes the `objectType`, let's look at an example where our `User` entity has an
`Address` associated with it.

```ts
const Address = objectType<Address>({
  name: 'Address',
  fields: (t) => ({
    street: t.exposeString('name'),
    houseNumber: t.exposeInt('houseNumber'),
    city: t.exposeString('city'),
    country: t.exposeString('country'),
  }),
})

addNodeFields(UserNode, t => ({
  address: t.field({
    type: Address,
    resolve: (parent) => {
      // fetch address for parent.id (the user id)
    }
  })
}))
```

The Address has no primary key, but is contextual to the `user` and
we'll fetch it in the context of our parent user.

You can still integrate `dataloader` here by switching out the
`t.field` with `t.loadable` or `t.loadableList` if the user would
have multiple addresses.

```ts
addNodeFields(UserNode, (t) => ({
  address: t.loadable({
    type: Address,
    load: ids => {
      /** Load the addresses for all given user-ids */
    }
    resolve: (parent, args) => {
      /** Return the contextual user-id */
      return parent.id
    }
  }),
}))
```

## Enums

There are types where you want to narrow down the possible values for a
given field, this can be done by means of the `enumType`. In this case
let's give our `BlogPost` a state, this can be published or draft:

```ts
const PostStatus = enumType({
  name: 'PostStatus',
  // The "as" const is important so TypeScript knows
  // this array can't change and can easily give you
  // type-hints.
  values: ['PUBLISHED', 'DRAFT', 'UNKNOWN'] as const,
})

addNodeFields(BlogPostnode, t => ({
  status: t.field({
    type: PostStatus,
    resolve: (parent) => {
      if (parent.published) {
        return 'PUBLISHED'
      } else if (parent.draft) {
        return 'DRAFT'
      }

      return 'UNKNOWN'
    }
  })
}))
```

Now when the types are generated on the front-end it will know
that `post.status` can have these three given values.

## Interfaces

Our API also supports inheritance, with `interfaces` we can define
a common shape across objects. Think about the built-in `Node` interface
which dictates that any `node` implements the `id` property.

We can go further and define `interfaces` ourself as well, let's look
at an example

```ts
const ContentNode = interfaceType({
  name: 'ContentNode',
  fields: (t) => ({
    title: t.string()
  }),
})

const BlogPostNode = node<{ id: string; title: string; content: string }>({
  name: 'BlogPost',
  interfaces: [ContentNode],
  load: async (ids) => [],
  isTypeOf: (parent: any) => {
    return !!parent.content
  },
  fields: (t) => ({
    title: t.exposeString('title'),
    content: t.exposeString('content'),
  }),
})

addQueryFields(t => ({
  content: t.field({
    type: [ContentNode],
    resolve: () => []
  })
}))
```

In the above example we define a `ContentNode` that tells us that every implemeentor
needs to have a `title` property of type `string`, then we go on to create our `content`
entry-point and tell us that any returned value here can be an implementor of the
`ContentNode` type. On the `BlogPost` you'll see a `isTypeOf` function, this is needed
to tell which implementor of the interface is being returned.

We can query this by doing

```graphql
query {
  content {
    title
    ... on BlogPost {
      id content
    }
    __typename
  }
}
```

Checking the `__typename` on the front-end will narrow down the type and you can
add logic based on the specific concrete type.

## Unions

Some endpoints will return multiple possible types, with unions you can
catch this case. Let's look at a case where we got an entry-point named
`content`, this can return `blogposts` or `advertisements`

> On the `Content` type you can see a `resolveType` function, this is an
> alternative to the aforementioned `isTypeOf` function from the
> `interfaceType` section.

```ts
const BlogPostNode = node<{ id: string, content: string }>({
  name: 'BlogPost',
  load: async (ids) => [],
  fields: (t) => ({
    content: t.exposeString('content'),
  }),
})

const AdvertisementNode = node<{ id: string, title: string }>({
  name: 'Advertisement',
  load: async (ids) => [],
  fields: (t) => ({
    title: t.exposeString('title'),
  }),
})

const Content = unionType({
  name: 'Content',
  types: [BlogPostNode, AdvertisementNode],
  // This is needed so we can tell the field what type
  // we are dealing with.
  resolveType(blogOrAdvertisement) {
    if (blogOrAdvertisement.title) {
      return 'Advertisement'
    } else {
      return 'BlogPost'
    }
  },
})

addQueryFields(t => ({
  content: t.field({
    type: [Content],
    resolve: () => []
  })
}))
```

We can query this by doing

```graphql
query {
  content {
    ... on BlogPost {
      id content
    }
    ... on Advertisement {
      id title
    }
    __typename
  }
}
```

Checking the `__typename` on the front-end will narrow down the type and you can
add logic based on the specific concrete type.
