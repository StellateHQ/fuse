# Queries and Mutations

The datalayer consists of entry-points which we will use to fulfill our data-requirements, often
when we start a new page we'll need to either use an existing entry-point or create a new one.

For retrieving data one or more of those entry-points can be created with the `addQueryFields` function.

```typescript
import { addQueryFields } from 'fuse'

addQueryFields(t => ({
  me: t.field({
    type: UserNode,
    resolve: (parent, args, context) => context.userId
  })
}))
```

The above could for instance be an entry-point for a `profile` page or any page that has a menu-dropdown
welcoming the user.

Our datalayer should also be able to manipulate data, these are referred to as `mutations` and can be added
similarly to `query` entry-points by means of `addMutationFields`.

```typescript
import { addMutationFields } from 'fuse'

addMutationFields(t => ({
  sayHello: t.field({
    type: 'String',
    args: {
      name: t.arg.string({ required: true })
    }
    resolve: (parent, args, context) => `Hello ${args.name}!`
  })
}))
```

Now we have an entry-point to retrieve our own user and to greet a user!

## Arguments

As you can see in the above examples we can define arguments for our entry-points, these arguments are optional
by default and can be made required by means of `{ required: true }`. All scalar values have their own `t.arg`
which can be used to define arguments on a field. The mention of `field` is important here as arguments
aren't exclusive to `query` and `mutation` entry-points, they can be used on any field. An example of this could
be when we `extend` the `UserNode` and want to add a `friends` field to it, we can add `args` there to make the list
of friends paginated.

Summing up all the built-in arguments we have:

- `id`
- `string`
- `boolean`
- `int`
- `float`

Most of these also have a `*List` equivalent to indicate you will pass an array of that scalar type.

We won't always be passing in scalar-values and we might even want to re-use certain inputs for multiple fields,
like for example a `PaginationInput` which we can use on any field we paginate over. We can do this by importing
`inputType` from `fuse` and creating one as followed

```typescript
import { inputType } from 'fuse'

const PaginationInput = inputType({
  name: 'PaginationInput',
  fields: (t) => ({
    offset: t.int({ defaultValue: 0 }),
    limit: t.int({ defaultValue: 10 }),
  }),
})
```

Now when we want to use `PaginationInput` we can pass it to `t.arg`, for example `{ pagination: t.arg({ type: PaginationInput }) }`.

Now we can pass this input to our `fields` accepting these arguments!
