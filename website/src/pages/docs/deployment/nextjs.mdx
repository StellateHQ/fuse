# Deploying with Next.js API Routes

Fuse exposes its API as an API route at `/api/fuse` when you use [the Next.js plugin](/docs/setting-fuse-up-manually/nextjs).

That means when you deploy your Next.js app (to Vercel, Netlify, or similar hosts that support Next.js API routes) your API will be deployed with it automatically! No extra steps needed.
