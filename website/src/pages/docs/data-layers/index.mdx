# Introduction to Data Layers

We think Fuse is the best library for building data layers at scale. However, the data layer pattern is a general architectural pattern that many successful companies have implemented themselves.

## What is a data layer?

A data layer is a dedicated service between the backend APIs and the clients. Crucially, it is owned by the frontend teams, enabling them to connect, transform, and extend backend APIs for their UIs.

Data layers allow engineering teams to move at optimal speed. They achieve this by solving three core problems at the interface between backend and frontend:

### Problem 1: Backend engineers think about resources, but frontend engineers think about user interfaces

Whether it's databases or microservices, resources are at the core of a backend engineer’s work. Frontend engineers, however, focus on bringing user stories and experiences to life.

Most companies today bridge this difference in thinking by having backend and frontend engineers collaborate to build APIs that match the frontend engineers’ needs.

But, that is often a slow and painful process because it requires governance, review, and consensus, all the while asking backend engineers to think more like frontend engineers and for frontend engineers to think more like backend engineers.

**Data layers enable each team to work however they prefer with minimal friction.** Backend teams continue exposing the resourced-based APIs they know and love, and frontend teams can transform the backend APIs to match their needs on their own.

### Problem 2: UI development gets blocked by API development

Different teams have different priorities, and development schedules are often misaligned. When the timing of deliverables is out of sync, the frontend teams are blocked until the backend teams finish implementing the backend APIs.

**Data layers allow engineering teams to parallelize their work.** Frontend teams can develop the UI even if the backend API isn’t ready because the UI can be implemented on top of the data layer independently of having actual data from the backend API. This means everything is ready to ship once the backend APIs are ready and plugged into the data layer.

### Problem 3: Resource-based APIs are one-size-fits-all, but different UIs need different data

UIs need to adapt to their specific environment. Each device and form factor has unique needs, but resource-based APIs are a one-size-fits-all solution that can’t adapt to such variability. Therefore, they have to cover the union of all the clients, rendering the APIs bloated for most client needs, often directly impacting performance.

**Thanks to GraphQL, data layers expose flexible APIs that can cover different needs for different UIs.** GraphQL APIs enable this by defining what data is available, which the clients can query for *only* the exact data they need.

## What other solutions have people tried?

The three problems aren’t new to software development; companies have tried solving them for years.

Let's take a look at some of the most popular patterns and how they compare to building a data layer.
