# Best practices

There are some best practices we strongly believe in while developing with `fuse`.

## Don't interpolate <Explain>arguments</Explain>

When we are working with `field-arguments` it's important to either write them as a literal value i.e.

```gql
query {
  users(limit: 10) {
    nodes {
      id
      name
    }
  }
}
```

or interpolate them as variables

```gql
query ($limit: Int!) {
  users(limit: $limit) {
    nodes {
      id
      name
    }
  }
}
```

String concatenation like `limit: ${myJsLimitValue}` is discouraged!

## Fragment naming

We suggest that you follow a naming pattern with fragments to make them both easy to discover
as well as easy to understand to what component they relate.

When we name our fragments like `Filename_TypeFields` we can easily see which component the fragment
relates to when it's being <Explain term='fragment-spreads'>spread</Explain> into a query. This allows
us to also easily know that we can remove the fragment once we remove the component.

An example of this could be the following, when we have an `Author.ts` file we would define a fragment
that looks like

```gql
fragment Author_UserFields on User {
  id
  name
  avaatarUrl
}
```

Now when we spread it in our `Blog` page we can easily see that it relates to the `Author` component, when we
inspect the GraphQL <Explain term='documents'>document</Explain> being sent to the server
we can also derive that this is meant for that component.

## `useFragment` and `FragmentType`

You'll see that we use this `useFragment` function in our components that have a fragment describing their
data-requirements, this helper ensures that we remove any extraneous fields and type the output correctly.
Another thing worth noting is how we type the `props`, we use this `FragmentType` helper which ensures that
the parent-component uses the fragment and passes that into props, this means that if the parent-component
would define all the fields of the fragment manually and not spread it that we would show a warning.

  Note that even though this function is called `useFragment`, it is **not a React hook and you need to use it in server components too**.
</Callout>

## Top-level queries

One of the benefits that comes with describing the data you need is that you perform 1 request and get 1 response,
no waterfall where you need to wait for the list and then perform a whole set of other requests to enrich that data, ...
We wrangle the data once, with this comes our sugestion to aggregate the data you need by means of your fragments at
the page-level, in doing so you resolve all data in a single request.

With modals/... that pop up you can do one-off requests later when you need the data but not having a waterfall of loading
spinners because you are navigating around feels both more performant and more user-friendly.
