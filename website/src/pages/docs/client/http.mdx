# HTTP

Fuse creates a standard GraphQL API under the hood, which means you can use any HTTP client to construct a request and fetch data from your API.

Note that we **strongly recommend using a GraphQL client if your application is a web or mobile app**. Practically all popular mobile and web frameworks and languages have a GraphQL client.

## How to query your GraphQL API via HTTP


Fundamentally, requests to GraphQL APIs are `POST` requests with a JSON body. The JSON body contains a `query` field, which is a string containing the GraphQL query, and an optional `variables` field, which is a JSON object containing the variables used in the query.

Example:

```
POST http://localhost:4000/graphql

Content-Type: application/json
Accept: application/json

{
  "query": "query getUser($id: ID!) { user(id: $id) { name } }",
  "variables": { "id": 1 }
}
```
