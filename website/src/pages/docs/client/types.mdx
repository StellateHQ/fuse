# Type generation

By default fuse will use [`gql.tada`](https://gql-tada.0no.co/) to type your GraphQL documents.

Folks who have been with fuse longer might still be on the GraphQL Code Generator default,
we still support this! We'll check whether `tadaOutputLocation` is set in the `tsconfig` and
whether you have `gql.tada` intalled. If not, we'll fall back to the GraphQL Code Generator.

## Migrating to gql.tada

To migrate to `gql.tada` we'll need to ensure that the LSP is working correctly and is upgraded to v1,
when that is working we can install `gql.tada` and add `tadaOutputLocation: '{src}/fuse/introspection.ts'` to
the graphqlsp config in the `tsconfig` file.

After that you can delete the `fragment-masking`, `gql` and `graphql` typescript files which are present in
the `fuse` folder.

## Opting out of gql.tada

You can opt out of `gql.tada by` uninstalling the package and removing `tadaOutputLocation` from the `tsconfig`.
