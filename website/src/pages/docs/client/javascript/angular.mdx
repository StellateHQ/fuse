# Angular

Fuse supports querying your data from angular, as long as your querying library supports typed-document nodes then
your output and variables will be typed. An example client would be [Apollo-angular](https://the-guild.dev/graphql/apollo-angular/docs)

Constructing a typed-document-node for a query:

```tsx
import { graphql } from '../fuse'
import { Avatar, AvatarFragment } from './components/Avatar'

const UserQuery = graphql(`
  query User ($id: ID!) {
    user(id: $id) {
      name
      ...Avatar_UserFields
    }
  }
`, [AvatarFragment]) // this is only needed with gql.tada as it doesn't support global fragments
```

and for a fragment:

```tsx
import { graphql, useFragment, FragmentType } from '../../fuse'

export const AvatarFragment = graphql(`
  fragment Avatar_UserFields on User {
    name
    avatarUrl
  }
`)

// Derive the input-type: FragmentType<typeof AvatarFragment>
// Apply fragment-masking: useFragment(AvatarFragment, user);
```
