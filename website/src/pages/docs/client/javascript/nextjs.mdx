# Querying from Next.js

Fuse supports querying your API from Next.js's new [App Router](#app-router) (including dedicated support for [server components](#server-components) and [server actions](#server-actions)) and from the original [Pages Router](#pages-router).

## App router

### Client components

When you are leveraging the `use client` directive in a `/app` component we have opted out
of using server-components. This means we are going back to the traditional way of
distributing our client over `React.context`.

It is advisable to create a `Provider` component with `'use client'` that you use in your
root-layout component so we are enabled to query data in any client page.

```tsx
'use client'

import {
  Provider,
  createClient,
} from '@/fuse/client'
import React from 'react'

export const DatalayerProvider = (props: any) => {
  const [client, ssr] = React.useMemo(() => {
    const { client, ssr } = createClient({
      url: 'http://localhost:3000/api/fuse',
      // This is used during SSR to know when the data finishes loading
      suspense: true,
    })

    return [client, ssr]
  }, [])

  return (
    <Provider client={client} ssr={ssr}>
      <React.Suspense>
        {props.children}
      </React.Suspense>
    </Provider>
  )
}
```

Let's add this to `app/layout.tsx` so we are enabled to query data in any subsequent page.
Querying data cna be done by using the `useQuery` hook from your generated fuse folder.

```tsx
import { useQuery } from '@/fuse/client'
import { graphql } from '@/fuse'
import { AvatarFragment } from './Avatar'

const UserQuery = graphql(`
  query User ($id: ID!) {
    user(id: $id) {
      ...Avatar_UserFields
    }
  }
`, [AvatarFragment]) // this is only needed with gql.tada as it doesn't support global fragments

function User() {
  const [result] = useQuery({
    query: UserQuery,
    variables: { id: '1' },
  })
}
```

When you need to reach into your mutatation entry points we supply `useMutation` as well.

```tsx
import { graphql } from '@/fuse'
import { useMutation } from '@/fuse/client'
import { AvatarFragment } from './Avatar'

const UpdateUser = graphql(`
  mutation UpdateUser ($id: ID!, firstName: $String!) {
    user(id: $id, firstName: $firstName) {
      ...Avatar_UserFields
    }
  }
`, [AvatarFragment]) // this is only needed with gql.tada as it doesn't support global fragments

const UpdateUser = () => {
  const [result, update] = useMutation(UpdateUser)

  return (
    <button onClick={() => update({ id: '1', firstName: 'John' })}>
      Update user
    </button>
  )
}
```

> call `router.refresh()` to re-render your server-component. The router is a hook

For data queried from client-components the client cache will recognise that data got
altered and performa refetch. The cache matches this by means of the `__typename` property
that is available on the data.

> Heads up, when you query a list of items that is empty we won't be able to infer the
> `__typename` and you will need to supply it yourself.

```tsx
import { useMemo } from 'react'
import { graphql } from '@/fuse'
import { useQuery } from '@/fuse/client'
import { AvatarFragment } from './Avatar'

const UserQuery = graphql(`
  query User ($id: ID!) {
    user(id: $id) {
      ...Avatar_UserFields
    }
  }
`, [AvatarFragment]) // this is only needed with gql.tada as it doesn't support global fragments

const User = () => {
  const [result] = useQuery({
    query: UserQuery,
    variables: { id: '1' },
    context: useMemo(() => ({ additionalTypenames: ['User'] }), []),
  })
}

```

Similar to the above we can perform mutations on the client as well by means of the `useMutation` hook,
this hook is lazy, when we invoke it we'll get a function that we can invoke to execute it.

```tsx

import { graphql } from '@/fuse'
import { useMutation } from '@/fuse/client'
import { redirect } from 'next/navigation'

const SayHello = graphql(`
  mutation Hello($name: String!) {
    sayHello(name: $name)
  }
`)

export async function Greet(args: { name: string }) {
  const [result, execute] = useMutation(SayHello)

  return <button onClick={() => execute({ name })}>Greet</button>
}
```

### Server components

# Server Components

When using React server components, Fuse skips the intermediate step of reaching out to an
API endpoint and instead executes the GraphQL directly in the server component renderer:

```tsx
import { graphql } from '@/fuse'
import { execute } from '@/fuse/server'

const UserQuery = graphql(`
  query User($id: ID!) {
    user(id: $id) {
      id
      name
      firstName
      avatarUrl
    }
  }
`)

export default async function Page() {
  const result = await execute({ query: UserQuery, variables: { id: '1' } })
}
```

This is the base way to query your components through server-components, you can now
pass on the data to child components.

### Server actions

We can also invoke mutations as part of a [`server-action`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/data-fetching/forms-and-mutations#how-server-actions-work)
This requires us to create a new file, for example in this example we'll call a mutation with a name
argument that returns us `Hello ${args.name}`.

We create `actions/hello.ts` and give it the content of

```ts
'use server'

import { graphql } from '@/fuse'
import { execute } from '@/fuse/server'
import { redirect } from 'next/navigation'

const SayHello = graphql(`
  mutation Hello($name: String!) {
    sayHello(name: $name)
  }
`)

export async function sayHello(args: { name: string }) {
  const result = await execute({ query: SayHello, variables: { name: args.name } })

  console.log(result.data?.sayHello)

  // After completing our mutation we perform a redirect
  redirect('/')
}
```

We can use this on the client by doing

```tsx
import { sayHello } from './actions/sayHello'

const Component = ({ name }) => {
  const sayHelloFuse = sayHello.bind(undefined, { name: name || 'fuse' })
  return (
    <form action={sayHelloFuse}>
      <button type='submit'>Say hello and redirect to /</button>
    </form>
  )
}
```

## Pages Router

Similar to the `/app` directory we can leverage `useQuery` the difference being that for server-side
data we will query manually from `getServerSideProps` or `getStaticProps` and pass it into the component.

```tsx
import {
  useQuery,
  withGraphQLClient,
  initGraphQLClient,
  ssrExchange,
  cacheExchange,
  fetchExchange,
} from '@/fuse/pages'
import { graphql } from '@/fuse'
import { AvatarFragment } from './Avatar'

const UserQuery = graphql(`
  query User ($id: ID!) {
    user(id: $id) {
      ...Avatar_UserFields
    }
  }
`, [AvatarFragment]) // this is only needed with gql.tada as it doesn't support global fragments

function User() {
  const [result] = useQuery({
    query: UserQuery,
    variables: { id: '1' },
  })
}

export async function getServerSideProps() {
  const ssrCache = ssrExchange({ isClient: false })
  const client = initGraphQLClient({
    url: 'http://localhost:3000/api/fuse',
    exchanges: [cacheExchange, ssrCache, fetchExchange],
  })

  await client.query(UserQuery, { id: '1' }).toPromise()

  const graphqlState = ssrCache.extractData()

  return {
    props: {
      graphqlState,
    },
  }
}

export default withGraphQLClient((ssrCache) => ({
  url: 'http://localhost:3000/api/fuse',
}))(Page)
```

Performing mutations is done in the same way as in the `/app` directory,
with the same caveats.
