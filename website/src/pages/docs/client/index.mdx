# Querying from the client


Fuse has first-class support for certain frameworks (working on adding more!). For these frameworks, it generates a type-safe API client during `fuse dev` and `fuse build` (see [how to opt-out of client code generation](#disabling-the-client-code-generation) below):

- [React & React Native (first-class)](/docs/client/react)
- [Next.js (first-class)](/docs/client/nextjs)
- [Vue (first-class)](/docs/client/vue)
- [Angular (first-class)](/docs/client/angular)

Fuse creates a GraphQL API at its core, which means **your API is compatible with any GraphQL client in any language** or even just send HTTP requests for languages that don't have GraphQL clients:

- [iOS (Swift)](/docs/client/ios)
- [Android (Java/Kotlin)](/docs/client/android)
- [HTTP](/docs/client/http)

We also keep a [list of recommended best practices for client data fetching](/docs/client/best-practices), specifically we strongly encourage the use of fragment co-location.

## Client code generation (first-class support)

When you run `fuse dev/build` (or `next dev/build` if using [the Next.js plugin](/docs/setting-fuse-up-manually/nextjs)), Fuse will automatically generate a type-safe GraphQL API client for React, React Native & Next.js.

### What it generates

When you generate the type-safe client, you'll see the `fuse/` folder populate
with a bunch of files. These don't need to be touched and are mostly there to
help with typing your results, variables and facilitating the client-methods.

Let's go over each file:

- [`fuse/client.ts`](/docs/basics/client/client-components): This is the main entry-point for React client components (including `'use client'` in Next.js's App Router). It exports the `useQuery`/... hooks which you can use in your
  client components to talk to your datalayer.
- [`fuse/server.ts`](/docs/basics/client/server-components): This is the main entry-point for React server components and server actions. It exports an `execute` function
  which takes a <Explain term='documents'>`Document`</Explain> and `variables` and will execute the operation in-process without an extra HTTP request to the API.
- [`fuse/fragment-masking.ts`](/docs/basics/client/best-practices): The `useFragment` and `FragmentType` helpers are exported from here,
  these helpers basically ensure that the props you pass in will be reduced to the selection of fields
  of your <Explain term='fragments'>fragment</Explain>.
- `fuse/gql.ts`: The `graphql()` function is exported from here, this helper ensures that both the `Result`
  and `Variables` are typed correctly for a given <Explain term='documents'>`Document`</Explain>.
- `fuse/graphql.ts`: This file contains a translation of your GraphQL schema to TypeScript types.
  It also contains the <Explain term='documents'>`Document`</Explain> type which is a helper type to type your GraphQL documents.
- [`fuse/pages.ts`](/docs/basics/client/page-components) (Next.js-only): This is the main entry-point for the Next.js `/pages` router.
  It exports the `withUrqlClinet` and `initUrqlClient` to work with `getServerSideProps`, ...
  As well as React hooks which you can use in your components.

### Disabling the client code generation

If you want to opt-out of this, for example if you want to keep your API in a dedicated repository OR if you're querying Fuse from an unsupported framework, you can add the `--server` flag to `fuse dev/build` to only develop and build the API server, but not generate a client.

Corrolarily, if you want to generate a client without running the server, you can run `fuse dev/build` with the `--client` flag to only run the client code generation but not develop/build the API server.

```sh
fuse dev --server # only develop the API server
fuse dev --client # only generate the React client

fuse build --server # only build the API server
fuse build --client # only build the React client
```
