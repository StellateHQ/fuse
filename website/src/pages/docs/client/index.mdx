# Querying from the client

Fuse comes with first-class support for an ever expanding list of frameworks. For these frameworks, it generates a type-safe API client for you:

- [React (first-class)](/docs/client/react)
- [Next.js (first-class)](/docs/client/nextjs)

However, since the API Fuse creates is a standard GraphQL API at the end, you can access it from [any other client](/docs/client/other) with your favorite GraphQL client as well.

We also keep a [list of recommended best practices for client data fetching](/docs/client/best-practices).

## Generated client files

When you run `fuse dev` (or `next dev` if using [the Next.js plugin](/docs/frameworks/nextjs)) you'll see the `fuse/` folder populate
with a bunch of files. These don't need to be touched and are mostly there to
help with typing your results, variables and facilitating the client-methods.

Let's go over each file:

- [`fuse/server.ts`](/docs/basics/client/server-components): This is the main entry-point for working with server-components and server-actions. It exports an `execute` function
  which takes a <Explain term='documents'>`Document`</Explain> and `variables` and will perform that on the datalayer.
- [`fuse/client.ts`](/docs/basics/client/client-components): This is the main entry-point for the `/app` directory when you are
  in `'use client'` mode. It exports the `useQuery`/... hooks which you can use in your
  components to talk to your datalayer.
- [`fuse/fragment-masking.ts`](/docs/basics/client/best-practices): The `useFragment` and `FragmentType` helpers are exported from here,
  these helpers basically ensure that the props you pass in will be reduced to the selection of fields
  of your <Explain term='fragments'>fragment</Explain>.
- `fuse/gql.ts`: The `graphql()` function is exported from here, this helper ensures that both the `Result`
  and `Variables` are typed correctly for a given <Explain term='documents'>`Document`</Explain>.
- `fuse/graphql.ts`: This file contains a translation of your GraphQL schema to TypeScript types.
  It also contains the <Explain term='documents'>`Document`</Explain> type which is a helper type to type your GraphQL documents.
- [`fuse/pages.ts`](/docs/basics/client/page-components) (Next.js-only): This is the main entry-point for the Next.js `/pages` router.
  It exports the `withUrqlClinet` and `initUrqlClient` to work with `getServerSideProps`, ...
  As well as React hooks which you can use in your components.
