# Fuse.js Introduction

Fuse.js is an open-source library for building [data layers](/docs/data-layers). ([star us on GitHub!](https://github.com/StellateHQ/fuse.js)) It empowers frontend & mobile teams to build and own the central translation layer from the backend microservices, data stores, & third-party APIs to the optimal GraphQL API for their websites, web apps, and mobile apps.

Fuse.js combines the best tooling from the GraphQL ecosystem to guide you to an organizational and technical “pit of success.” While it uses GraphQL (because it is the best technical choice) and familiarity with GraphQL will make for a minimal learning curve, **you do not need to know GraphQL to use Fuse.js.**

# Getting Started

## Before you begin

Before you start using Fuse.js, you need to have:

- Familiarity with TypeScript
- A Next.js app*

\**Note that a Fuse.js data layer can also be developed and deployed outside of Next.js. However, our current focus is on making the experience with Next.js great, so expect rough edges elsewhere.*

## Setting up your data layer

When you are in the folder of your existing `next.js` application you can run `npx create-fuse-app` which will
run the steps described in [the manual setup guide](./basics/setting-fuse-up-manually.mdx) for you.

Now, if you run `next dev` and open `localhost:3000/api/fuse` in the browser, you'll see GraphiQL and be able to query for a user:

## Querying your data layer

> At this point you will need to run `next dev` so our entry-points can be generated for you.

This example will focus on `server-components` but you can query your data from anywhere,
other examples can be found [in the client chapter](./basics/client.mdx).
When using `server-components` we can skip the intermediate step of reaching out to an
endpoint, hence our codegen has generated an alternative entry-point in `./fuse/server`.

```tsx
import { graphql } from '@/fuse'
import { execute } from '@/fuse/server'

const UserQuery = graphql(`
  query User($id: ID!) {
    user(id: $id) {
      id
      name
      firstName
      avatarUrl
    }
  }
`)

export default async function Page() {
  const result = await execute({ query: UserQuery, variables: { id: '1' } })
}
```

This is the base way to query your components through server-components, you can now
pass on the data to child components.
