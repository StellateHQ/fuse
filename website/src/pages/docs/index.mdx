# Fuse.js Introduction

Fuse.js is an open-source library for building [data layers](/docs/data-layers). ([star us on GitHub!](https://github.com/StellateHQ/fuse.js)) It empowers frontend & mobile teams to build and own the central translatation layer from the backend microservices, data stores, & third-party APIs to the optimal GraphQL API for their websites, web apps, and mobile apps.

Fuse.js combines the best tooling from the GraphQL ecosystem to guide you to an organizational and technical “pit of success.” While it uses GraphQL (because it is the best technical choice) and familiarity with GraphQL will make for a minimal learning curve, **you do not need to know GraphQL to use Fuse.js.**

# Getting Started

## Before you begin

Before you start using Fuse.js, you need to have:

- Familiarity with TypeScript
- A Next.js app*

\**Note that a Fuse.js data layer can also be developed and deployed outside of Next.js. However, our current focus is on making the experience with Next.js great, so expect rough edges elsewhere.*

## Setting up your Fuse data layer

<Steps>
### Install the npm packages

```sh npm2yarn
npm install --save fuse graphql
npm install --save-dev @graphql-typed-document-node/core
```

### Add the Next.js plugin to your `next.config.js`

```js
const { nextFusePlugin } = require('fuse/next/plugin')

/** @type {import('next').NextConfig} */
const nextConfig = nextFusePlugin()({
  // Your Next.js config here
})

module.exports = nextConfig
```

### Create the `/api/fuse` API route

This API route will serve as the entrypoint to the GraphQL API that Fuse.js creates. If you are using Next.js’s app router, add a file at `app/api/fuse/route.ts` and copy the below code to it:

```ts
import { createAPIRouteHandler } from 'fuse/next'

// NOTE: This makes Fuse.js automatically pick up every type in the /types folder
// Alternatively, you can manually import each type in the /types folder and remove this snippet
// @ts-expect-error
const files = require.context('../../../types', true, /\.ts$/)
files
  .keys()
  .filter((path: string) => path.includes('types/'))
  .forEach(files)

const handler = createAPIRouteHandler()

export const GET = handler
export const POST = handler
```

<Callout type="info" emoji="📄">
  If you are using Next.js's Pages Router, replace <code>createAPIRouteHandler</code> with <code>createPagesRouteHandler</code> instead.
</Callout>

That’s it! Fuse.js will now serve a GraphQL API at `/api/fuse`.

</Steps>

## Adding your first type

Create a `types` folder at the root of your Next.js app and add a file at `types/User.ts` that contains the following code:

```ts
import { node } from 'fuse'

type UserSource = {
  id: string
  name: string
  avatar_url: string
}

// "Nodes" are the core abstraction of Fuse.js. Each node represents
// a resource/entity with multiple fields and has to define two things:
// 1. load(): How to fetch from the underlying data source
// 2. fields: What fields should be exposed and added for clients
export const UserNode = node<UserSource>({
  name: 'User',
  load: async (ids) => getUsers(ids),
  fields: (t) => ({
    name: t.exposeString('name'),
    // rename to camel-case
    avatarUrl: t.exposeString('avatar_url'),
    // Add an additional firstName field
    firstName: t.string({
      resolve: (user) => user.name.split(' ')[0],
    }),
  }),
})

// Fake function to fetch users. In real applications, this would
// talk to an underlying REST API/gRPC service/third-party API/…
async function getUsers(ids: string[]): Promise<UserSource[]> {
  return ids.map((id) => ({
    id,
    name: `Peter #${id}`,
    avatarUrl: `https://i.pravatar.cc/300?u=${id}`,
  }))
}
```

Note how the only code you had to write was the translation from the underlying data source to the shape of the data that you need. Fuse.js takes care of everything else for you.

If you now open `localhost:3000/api/fuse` in the browser, you'll see GraphiQL and be able to query for a user:

## Querying your data layer

Fuse.js offers three entry-points to querying your data, depending on your use case:

- React-Server-Components `fuse/next/server`
- React-Client-Components in the `/app` directory `fuse/next/client`
- React-Client Components in the `/pages` directory `fuse/next/pages`

### React-Server-Components

When we are using `react-server-components` we have to register our client before we can start querying.

```tsx
import { registerClient, createClient, fetchExchange } from 'fuse/next/server'

const { getClient } = registerClient(() =>
  createClient({
    url: 'http://localhost:3000/api/fuse',
    exchanges: [fetchExchange],
  }),
)
```

In doing so we register a client with `React.cache` that can be re-used across
server-components.

```tsx
import { graphql } from '@/gql'

const UserQuery = graphql(`
  query User($id: ID!) {
    user(id: $id) {
      id
      name
      firstName
      avatarUrl
    }
  }
`)

export default async function Page() {
  const result = await getClient().query(UserQuery, {
    id: '1',
  });
}
```

This is the base way to query your components through server-components, you can now
pass on the data to child components, ...

### React-Client-Components in the `/app` directory

When you are leveraging the `use client;` directive in a `/app` component we have opted out
of using server-components. This means we are going back to the traditional way of
distributing our client over `React.context`.

It is advisable to create a `Provider` component with `"use client";` that you use in your
root-layout component so we are enabled to query data in any client page.

```tsx
import {
  Provider,
  ssrExchange,
  cacheExchange,
  fetchExchange,
  createClient,
} from 'fuse/next/client'
import React from 'react'

export const DatalayerProvider = (props: any) => {
  const [client, ssr] = React.useMemo(() => {
    const ssr = ssrExchange()
    const client = createClient({
      url: 'http://localhost:3000/api/fuse',
      exchanges: [cacheExchange, ssr, fetchExchange],
      suspense: true,
    })

    return [client, ssr]
  }, [])

  return (
    <Provider client={client} ssr={ssr}>
      {props.children}
    </Provider>
  )
}
```

Let's add this to `app/layout.tsx` so we are enabled to query data in any subsequent page.
Querying data cna be done by using the `useQuery` hook from `fuse/next/client`.

```tsx
import { useQuery } from 'fuse/next/client'

function Launches() {
  const [result] = useQuery({
    query: UserQuery,
    variables: { id: '1' },
  })
}
```

Linearly, we supply `useMutation` for your mutation needs.

> When you mutate data that affects a server-component you will need to call `router.refresh()` to
> re-render your server-component.

### React-Client-Components in the `/pages` directory

Similar to the `/app` directory we can leverage `useQuery` the difference being that for server-side
data we will query manually from `getServerSideProps` or `getStaticProps` and pass it into the component.

```tsx
import {
  useQuery,
  withGraphQLClient,
  initGraphQLClient,
  ssrExchange,
  cacheExchange,
  fetchExchange,
} from 'fuse/next/pages'

function Launches() {
  const [result] = useQuery({
    query: UserQuery,
    variables: { id: '1' },
  })
}

export async function getServerSideProps() {
  const ssrCache = ssrExchange({ isClient: false })
  const client = initGraphQLClient({
    url: 'http://localhost:3000/api/fuse',
    exchanges: [cacheExchange, ssrCache, fetchExchange],
  })

  await client.query(UserQuery, { id: '1' }).toPromise()

  const graphqlState = ssrCache.extractData()

  return {
    props: {
      graphqlState,
    },
  }
}

export default withGraphQLClient((ssrCache) => ({
  url: 'http://localhost:3000/api/fuse',
  exchanges: [cacheExchange, ssrCache, fetchExchange],
}))(Page)
```

## Adding in-line hints and validation (optional)

You can use `@0no-co/graphqlsp` to get inline hints while authoring GraphQL documents, you can do so by installing it
and using the following in your `tsconfig.json`

```json
{
  "name": "@0no-co/graphqlsp",
  "schema": "./schema.graphql",
  "disableTypegen": true,
  "templateIsCallExpression": true,
  "template": "graphql"
}
```

When using `.vscode` you will need to use the workspace version of TypeScript, to do so you can easily do that by creating
`.vscode/settings.json` with the following content

```json
{
  "typescript.tsdk": "node_modules/typescript/lib",
  "typescript.enablePromptUseWorkspaceTsdk": true
}
```
