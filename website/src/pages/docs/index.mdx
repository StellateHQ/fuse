# Fuse.js Introduction

Fuse.js is an open-source library for building data layers. Frontend engineers use data layers to translate any number of backend microservices, data stores, & third-party APIs into a GraphQL API that they can consume from their websites, web apps, and mobile apps.

Fuse.js combines the best tooling from the GraphQL ecosystem to guide you to an organizational and technical “pit of success.” This allows you to spend more time shipping features instead of spending time setting up tooling or fighting your backend engineering roadmap.

# Getting Started

## Before you begin

Before you start using Fuse.js, you need to have:

- Familiarity with TypeScript
- A Next.js app*

\**Note that a Fuse.js data layer can also be developed and deployed outside of Next.js. However, our current focus is on making the experience with Next.js great, so expect rough edges elsewhere.*

## Setting up your Fuse data layer

<Steps>
### Install the npm packages

```sh npm2yarn
npm install --save fuse graphql
npm install --save-dev @graphql-typed-document-node/core
```

### Add the Next.js plugin to your `next.config.js`

```js
const { nextFusePlugin } = require('fuse/next/plugin')

/** @type {import('next').NextConfig} */
const nextConfig = nextFusePlugin()({
  // Your Next.js config here
})

module.exports = nextConfig
```

### Create the `/api/fuse` API route

This API route will serve as the entrypoint to the GraphQL API that Fuse.js creates. If you are using Next.js’s app router, add a file at `app/api/fuse/route.ts` and copy the below code to it:

```ts
import { createAPIRouteHandler } from 'fuse/next'

// NOTE: The below is a hack to make Next.js require all the files
// in the /types folder automatically
// @ts-expect-error
const keys = require.context('../../../types', true, /\.ts$/)
keys
  .keys()
  .filter((x: string) => x.includes('types/'))
  .forEach(keys)

const handler = createAPIRouteHandler()

export const GET = handler
export const POST = handler
```

### Add your first type

Create a `types` folder at the root of your Next.js app and add a file at `types/User.ts` that contains the following code:

```ts
import { node, addQueryFields } from 'fuse'

type UserResource = {
  id: string
  name: string
  avatarUrl: string
}

// "Nodes" are the core abstraction of Fuse.js. Each node represents
// a resource/entity with multiple fields and has to define two things:
// 1. load(): How to fetch multiple of itself based on a list of keys
// 2. fields: What fields the exposed object type should have
export const UserNode = node<UserResource>({
  name: 'User',
  load: async (ids) => getUsers(ids),
  fields: (t) => ({
    name: t.exposeString('name'),
    avatarUrl: t.exposeString('avatarUrl'),
  }),
})

// Adding a query that allows one to fetch a user by ID
addQueryFields(t => ({
  user: t.field({
    type: UserNode,
    args: {
      id: t.arg.string({ required: true }),
    },
    resolve: (_, args) => args.id,
  })
}))

// Fake function to fetch users. In real applications, this would
// talk to an underlying REST API/gRPC service/third-party API/…
async function getUsers(ids: string[]): Promise<UserResource[]> {
  return ids.map((id) => ({
    id,
    name: `Peter #${id}`,
    avatarUrl: `https://i.pravatar.cc/300?u=${id}`,
  }))
}
```

That’s it! Fuse.js will now serve a GraphQL API at `/api/fuse`.
</Steps>

## Querying your data layer

### TODO

### Adding in-line hints and validation

You can use `@0no-co/graphqlsp` to get inline hints while authoring GraphQL documents, you can do so by installing it
and using the following in your `tsconfig.json`

```json
{
  "name": "@0no-co/graphqlsp",
  "schema": "./schema.graphql",
  "disableTypegen": true,
  "templateIsCallExpression": true,
  "template": "graphql"
}
```

When using `.vscode` you will need to use the workspace version of TypeScript, to do so you can easily do that by creating
`.vscode/settings.json` with the following content

```json
{
  "typescript.tsdk": "node_modules/typescript/lib"
}
```
