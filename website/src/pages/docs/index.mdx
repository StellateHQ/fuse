# FuseJS

Fuse.js is an open-source library for building data layers. Frontend engineers use data layers to translate any number of backend microservices, data stores, & third-party APIs into a GraphQL API that they can consume from their websites, web apps, and mobile apps.

Fuse.js combines the best tooling from the GraphQL ecosystem to guide you to an organizational and technical “pit of success.” This allows you to spend more time shipping features instead of spending time setting up tooling or fighting your backend engineering roadmap.
