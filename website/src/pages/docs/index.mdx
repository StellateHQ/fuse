# Fuse.js Introduction

Fuse.js is an open-source library for building [data layers](/docs/data-layers). ([star us on GitHub!](https://github.com/StellateHQ/fuse.js)) It empowers frontend & mobile teams to build and own the central translation layer from the backend microservices, data stores, & third-party APIs to the optimal GraphQL API for their websites, web apps, and mobile apps.

Fuse.js combines the best tooling from the GraphQL ecosystem to guide you to an organizational and technical ‚Äúpit of success.‚Äù While it uses GraphQL (because it is the best technical choice) and familiarity with GraphQL will make for a minimal learning curve, **you do not need to know GraphQL to use Fuse.js.**

# Getting Started

## Before you begin

Before you start using Fuse.js, you need to have:

- Familiarity with TypeScript
- Basic familiarity with writing GraphQL queries*
- A Next.js app**

/***Note that we are working on improving the documentation so that Fuse.js doesn't even require basic familiarity with writing GraphQL queries */

\**Note that a Fuse.js data layer can also be developed and deployed outside of Next.js. However, our current focus is on making the experience with Next.js great, so expect rough edges elsewhere.*

<Steps>
### Set up your data layer

In the root folder of your existing Next.js application run `create-fuse-app` with npx, pnpm, or yarn:
```sh
npx create-fuse-app
```

```sh
pnpm create fuse-app
```

```sh
yarn create fuse-app
```
This will automatically set up Fuse.js for you, which consists of [five main steps](/docs/setting-fuse-up-manually):

1. Install the npm packages
2. Add the Next.js plugin to your `next.config.js`
3. Create the `/api/fuse` API route
4. Set up GraphQLSP to get IDE autocomplete
5. Adds a first example type in `types/User.ts`

It generates the example `User.ts` type to allow you to verify your Fuse.js setup (see the next step) and serves as an example how to use Fuse.js to build a data layer. However, please **delete the `types/User.ts` file once you start building your own data layer**.

### Verify your Fuse.js setup is working

Now, if you run `next dev` and open `localhost:3000/api/fuse` in the browser, you'll see GraphiQL and be able to query for a user:

</Steps>

You've now got a Fuse.js data layer setup with your Next.js app! üéâ Next, learn how to [query your Fuse.js data layer from the client](/docs/basics/client).
